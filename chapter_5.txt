Parametric test: test that requires the data being used to come from one of the statistical distributions and meet certain assumptions. 
 
     Assumptions: 1. normally distributed data (sample distribution or model errors -> (GLM) )
                       a. sampling distrubtion must be normally distributed (we don't have access to this, only to sample data)
                       b. per central limit theorem, for larger samples (N > 30), the sampling distribution tends to be normal,
                          so if the sampled data doesn't look normal but the sampling distribution is, we're ok (but not really). 
                       c. 
                  2. homogeneity of variance (variance between groups, between variable)
                  3. data must at least satisfy "interval criteria" 
                  4. independence (inter-sample independence)
                    
                    
                    
problem set:

       1. assess normality of data visually
       2. plot relationship between two variables (scatter plot)
          a. plot and explain regression line
          b. plot and explain 95% confidence interval 
       3. z-norm the data
          a. check for outliers (not visually)
          b. explain why they are outliers, and how you check them
