## Parametric test: test that requires the data being used to come from one of the statistical distributions and meet certain assumptions. 
 
    ## Assumptions: 1. normally distributed data (sample distribution or model errors)
                    2. homogeneity of variance (variance between groups, between variable)
                    3. data must at least satisfy "interval criteria" 
                    4. independence (sample independence)
